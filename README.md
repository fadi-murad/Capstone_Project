# Income Classification Project

## Problem Statement 
#### *Predict the income class of US population*
The aim of this project is to build a predictive model to determine the income level for people in the US. The income levels are binned at below 50K and above 50K.

## Overview
This is a binary classification problem with fairly huge data set (**300,000 records**) and imbalanced data (**94:6 class ratio**).
We will build different predictive models and compare their performance in order to choose the best model. 

## Project Content
I divided this project into 4 folders, the first folder contains data sets while the rest represent the steps of this project and contain the related R documents (in R, RMD and HTML formats) in addition to the related RData files.

### 1- Data Set
You can find train and test sets in csv format with columns names and ready to be loaded  
Weâ€™ve taken the data set from UCI Machine Learning Repository, and you can find the original data at:

### 2- Data Exploration
* Loading and checking data 
* Visualizing Variables

### 3- Data Cleaning and Manipulation 
* Dealing with Missing Values
* Near Zero Variance Variables
* Checking Levels train/test

### 4- Machine Learning

* Ideas to Start
  + Best Performance Measure
  + Sampling Techniques
  + Algorithms

* Machine Learning
  + Logistic Reg Model
  + Naive Bayes
  + Random Forest Model
  + Room for Improvement
